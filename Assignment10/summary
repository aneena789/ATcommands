The purpose of this evaluation was to carry out a complete SMS communication sequence using AT commands: AT, AT+CSQ, AT+CMGF=1, AT+CMGS, and AT+CMGR, and observe their outputs in an emulator. The modem responded appropriately to the basic connectivity check (AT) and showed a valid signal strength (+CSQ: 21,0). SMS text mode was successfully activated using AT+CMGF=1, and a test message ("HELLO WORLD") was sent via AT+CMGS to the specified mobile number. The command returned +CMGS: 1, confirming that the message was sent. However, when attempting to read the message using AT+CMGR=1, an ERROR occurred, indicating that the message might not have been stored at index 1 or that the memory location was inaccessible or unsupported.
